Golden Age of Television
In this project, you will work with data from the entertainment industry. You will study a dataset with records on movies and shows. The research will focus on the “Golden Age” of television, which began in 1999 with the release of The Sopranos and is still ongoing.
The aim of this project is to investigate how the number of votes a title receives from IMDb users impacts its ratings. The assumption is that highly-rated shows (we will focus on TV shows, ignoring movies) released during the “Golden Age” of television also have the most votes.
This project is similar to the tasks you will be getting in your job as a data professional. Many business decisions are initially born as assumptions, your contribution as an expert in the data domain is to answer the question “Did the assumption formulated before the study appear to be true?”

Stage 1: Data overview. The notebook has premade cells with instructions for what kind of code to write, as well as text blocks where you can write your observations.
Stage 2: Data preprocessing. In this stage, you’ll clean up column names and address missing and duplicate values. Follow the outline provided in the notebook and be sure to write about your observations at the end of this section.
Stage 3: Data analysis. This is the meat of your project. Walk through the coding steps needed to evaluate the assumption and comment on your results in the appropriate blocks. Finally, summarize the overall project in the “Conclusion” section which is equal to “Presenting Results” stage we mentioned in the lessons.
